I need to build a quadruped platform with basic control and estimation capability to support my own research. So after reading paper "MIT Cheetah 3: Design and control of a robust, dynamic quadruped robot" and "Dynamic locomotion in the mit cheetah 3 through convex model-predictive control", I implemented the controller and the state estimator described in these two papers. The code is avaiable on [Github](https://github.com/ShuoYangRobotics/A1-QP-MPC-Controller).

Based on this work I recently published [a paper on IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters](../_publications/2022-06-14-calibration.md).
