About Me
--------

I am the co-founder and CTO of Mondo Technology, a consumer robot company founded in 2025. Previously, I was a staff humanoid AI/robotics engineer at Tesla, working on the [Optimus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpraXaw7dyc) robot. Before moving to the Bay Area, I was a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I worked in the [Robot Exploration Lab](https://roboticexplorationlab.org/) and the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). My research advisors were Professor [Zachary Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) and Professor [Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/). My PhD research focused on state estimation for legged robots and complex robotics systems.

I obtained my B.Eng in Computer Engineering and M.Phil in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2012 and 2015, respectively. During my undergraduate studies, I was the team leader of the HKUST Robotics team for three years. This team represented Hong Kong in the [ABU Robocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon). During my graduate studies, I was the team leader of the HKUST IARC team in 2014. The team performed very well in the [IARC competition](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/), an aerial vehicle competition with more than 20 years of history. Some of my master's research work contributed to the flight control algorithm on DJI's product autopilot, [A3](https://www.dji.com/a3). 

Before joining CMU, I worked at [DJI](https://www.dji.com/) for 5 years. It was my honor to work with this company to change the world with drone technology. Starting as an algorithm engineer, I became a project technical director, leading the research and development of many famous drone and robotics products. The projects I was directly involved in include: [Inspire 1](https://www.dji.com/inspire-1), [Phantom 3](https://www.dji.com/phantom-3-pro), [Phantom 4](https://www.dji.com/phantom-4), [Matrice 100](https://www.dji.com/matrice100), [Mavic](https://www.dji.com/mavic), and various [robotics products](https://www.dji.com/robomaster-s1). The research drone platform Matrice 100, developed by my team and me, is one of the most popular drone research platforms in recent years.  


Other than robotics research, I am also enthusiastic about robotics education. At DJI, I led an educational project called [RoboMaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US). In this project, we created different opportunities for students to work on practical robots and be recognized by the entire society. Many famous international media outlets have covered my work on these projects.

Research Statement
------------------
I use numerical optimization methods to enable legged robots to achieve stable control performance and precise, low-drift, long-term state estimation. A key insight driving my research is that control and estimation have inherent connections. The fact that control and estimation are dual problems allows mathematical tools developed for one problem to be applied to the other, such as factor graphs and constrained trajectory optimization.

All of my research ideas are validated by rigorous mathematical derivations or hardware experiments. All of my control and estimation software projects are open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/ShuoYangRobotics).
